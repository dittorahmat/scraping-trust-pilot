Jennie K,GB,I love Huel,"I love Huel, I only use it 2 or 3 days a week  Banana and Salted Caramel are my favourites, cost effective and saves time preparing meals.",5 stars: Excellent,
Robert Conroy,GB,Best addition to my diet.,"Best addition to my diet in a long time. I use sweet and savoury for my lunch, being on the go all day I would often turn to sandwiches and snacks. I’ve been using Huel for 5 weeks now, not only has it saved me money it has also helped me get to a target weight by filling me for longer through the day.",5 stars: Excellent,
Laura,GB,Amazing company!,"Amazing company!! Have used Huel at breakfast and lunch for about 6 months now. Feel great on the stuff, satisfied but light and energetic. I know it’s not a weight loss food but I have even lost 4kg too as part of a calorie controlled diet. I like that I know exactly how many calories I’m consuming, but with the reassurance that I’m not lacking in any nutrients.",5 stars: Excellent,
Eliza Szarbiewska,DE,Before I've ordered Huel I wasn't sure…,"Before I've ordered Huel I wasn't sure what to think about the product, cause I've red many negative opinions on Facebook, still I gave it a try, because I wanted to try a meal that is vegetarian and gluten free at the same time. Yesterday I've tried green curry and it was really well spiced and filling. Today I gave a try for the banana coctail and it was also very tasty. I'd really reccomend Huel brand to my friends :)",5 stars: Excellent,

KateJonesLondon,GB,I’ve used Huel for a couple of years…,I’ve used Huel for a couple of years now. Tried another protein shake that a friend recommended and didn’t like it as much so back on chocolate Huel again! I blend it with almond milk and a banana for lunch and it’s quick and filling :) as a vegetarian I like the fact I’m getting a good dose of vitamins etc,4 stars: Great,

Ms Aisling,IE,The one that stays!!!,"I’m not good at taking protein powder. Whey doesn’t suit me and all past attempts at taking plant based powders have fallen short due to either texture or taste, being too sweet or have a weird after taste. Huel though, will most DEFINITELY be staying around. Love the chocolate brownie flavour, not too sweet which I’m thrilled about and I’m finally able to hit protein goals while also getting all my vitamins and minerals. So happy with my purchase!!",5 stars: Excellent,
K P Ford,SE,Great!,Great!,5 stars: Excellent,
Kelly Andrews,GB,Happy,Very happy with the delivery service came when expected and always got back to be when I had a question,5 stars: Excellent,
Alice Spires,GB,Add a banana !,I use a smoothie blender and almond milk to make mine (vanilla and banana white Huel mixed together) and throw in a banana (and sometimes a dollop of yoghurt) - lovely !  I also let it sit for a bit before drinking which helps to reduce any remaining graininess.,5 stars: Excellent,
stuart cook,GB,Wouldve been 4 or 5 stars if it wasnt…,"Wouldve been 4 or 5 stars if it wasnt for the fact that they force you to buy 3 of hot and savoury that you cant try to see if its any good as there is no tasters, real shame as i like what ive had so far (sweet and sour and korma). What it tells me is there is no confidence in their product, oh its to save on enviroment, rubbish its all down to money. 4.6 rating people like it you can do tasters huel stop the b.s.",1 star: Bad,
